------------------------------

Congratulations on getting this far. :-)

To start playing, install the ipython-nodebook, the postgresql
database server with python-psycopg. 

unpack the source tarbal, create a database and run the 
sql-create script from the sql folder.

cp the misc/config.py file to '.' the server root directory, 
ajust the config.py file to enter your database credentials and 
finaly run ``python admserver.py`` from the root directory where
you have unpacked the sources.

There are many sites explaning how to create a:
foo.crt and foo.key file for use with ssl /
https site. 

Create them and call them: self.crt and self.key
and put them in the cert folder.

What is the ADM server
----------------------

The ADM-server is a webbased tool for programming task formulation,
task assignment, solution submission and grading that will provide 
computer science teachers with a platform for these tasks.

At this stage the adm-server provides a very primitive but working 
interface for students and teachers. the main value is the solution 
submission and feedback based on the docstring of tests.
